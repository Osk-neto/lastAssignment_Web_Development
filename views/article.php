    <h1> Video games</h1>
    <p>It is nearly impossible to live in today’s modern age and not have some influence in your life from video games. They are in the news, they are on billboards, they influence various Hollywood movies, and they are basically all around us. Video games are made to entertain, to educate, and to now live active lifestyles, but over the course of only sixty years, the video game industry has changed drastically. New electronic breakthroughs are made every year, new games are created every six months, and online gaming changes daily. For years, it was thought to be a solely male hobby to take part in, but with the newest motion sensor technology by Nintendo with their Wii system, more and more women are becoming gamers every year.

</p>
    <p>To imagine the world without video games would be completely absurd at this point in time as some games tend to now make more money than world released movies and sporting events. It is because of the popularity of video games that gaming is one of the most accessible hobbies for both men and women to take part in individually, with friends, or with friends around the world online. To initially choose a gaming system to begin gaming with, one has to simply weigh the pros and cons of each system to choose accordingly. But before we choose what type of gaming counsel or games we would like to play, we must look at the fast moving pace of video game history to fully understand the hobby that is video games.</p>
